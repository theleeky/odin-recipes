        <li>1 lb shrimp,<strogng> peeled and deveined</strogng></li>
        <li>1 Tbsp oil</li>
        <li>1 small onion, finely chopped</li> 
        <li>2 Tbsp butter</li>
        <li>1 garlic cove</li>
        <li>2 cups double cream</li>
        <li>1/3 cup parmesan cheese</li>
        <li>basil for finish</li>

    <h4>Instructions</h4>
    <ol>
        <li>Cook 3/4 lb fettuccini noodles in salted water according to package instructions and drain.<br>
             Don't rinse (this helps the sauce stick to the noodles better).</li>
        <li>Lightly season shrimp with salt, pepper and paprika. Preheat a large skillet to med/high <br>
            and add 1 Tbsp oil. Once oil is hot, add shrimp in a single layer and cook 1-2 min per side or<br>
             just until fully cooked and no longer translucent. They should be golden/pink on the outside and <br>
             opaque white on the inside. Don't over-do it or they will be rubbery. Remove shrimp to a separate bowl.</li>
        <li>
            In same pan, over medium/high heat, add 2 Tbsp butter and onion and sauté onion till golden. Stir <br>
            in garlic and sauté another minute. Stir in 1/3 cup white wine and reduce to 25% scraping the bottom to deglaze the pan.
        </li>
        <li>
            Stir in Cream and simmer for 2 min. Next, sprinkle the top with 1/3 cup parmesan (or add to taste) <br>
            and stir just until creamy and smooth and remove from heat. Don't boil or the cheese will separate from <br>
            the cream. Add about 1/4 tsp paprika and season with S&P to taste.
        </li>
        <li>
            Add the cooked shrimp and drained (un-rinsed pasta). Garnish with parsley, basil, extra parmesan or freshly cracked pepper if desired.
