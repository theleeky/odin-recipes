    <h4>Instructions</h4>
    <ol>
        <li>
            Heat oven to 180C/fan 160C/gas 4. Grease a 20cm cake tin and line the<br>
             bottom with a circle of greaseproof paper.
        </li>
        <li>
            If you want to make life easy, simply put 225g butter, 225g caster sugar,<br>
             4 eggs, 225g self-raising flour, 3 tbsp milk and 1 tsp vanilla extract into <br>
             a food processor and whizz for 1-2 mins until smooth.
        </li>
        <li>
            If you prefer to mix by hand, beat 225g butter and 225g caster sugar together, <br>
            then add 4 eggs, one at a time, mixing well after each addition
        </li>
        <li>
            Fold through 225g self-raising flour, 3 tbsp milk and 1 tsp vanilla extract until the mixture is smooth.
        </li>
        <li>
            Divide the mixture between 2 bowls. Stir 2 tbsp cocoa powder into the mixture in <br>
            one of the bowls. Take 2 spoons and use them to dollop the chocolate and vanilla cake mixes into the tin alternately.
        </li>
        <li>
            When all the mixture has been used up (and if young kids are doing this, you’ll need <br>
            to ensure the base of the tin is fairly evenly covered), tap the bottom on your <br>
            work surface to ensure that there aren’t any air bubbles.
        </li>
        <li>
            Take a skewer and swirl it around the mixture in the tin a few times to create a marbled effect.
        </li>
        <li>
            Bake the cake for 45-55 mins until a skewer inserted into the centre comes out clean. <br>
            Turn out onto a cooling rack and leave to cool. Will keep for 3 days in an airtight container or freeze for up to 3 months.
        </li>
