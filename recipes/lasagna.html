        </li>
        <li>
            In a large saucepan, mix sausage or ground beef and 1 1/12 of the marinara sauce. Let it simmer for 5 minutes.
        </li>
        <li>
            In a separate bowl, mix Ricotta, 3 1/2 cups of mozzarella, Parmigiano-Reggiano, and eggs.

            Repeat the layers starting from the noodles to the meat sauce twice. Top the meat <br>
             sauce with the remaining marinara sauce and sprinkle with the remaining mozzarella cheese.
